Whalebone is a service for security filtering of DNS traffic. It uses logic on top of own DNS resolvers. Such resolvers could be either cloud ones maintained directly by Whalebone, or on-premise software resolvers using cloud just for threat intelligence updates and reporting. For threat prevention Whalebone relies on external intelligence sources as well as on own methods.
