Integrations
------------
Whalebone API is a practical way to access all the data that are gathered by Whalebone's resolvers and integrate them to external systems. The API documentation can be accessed at https://apidocs.whalebone.io/public/

In order to authenticate to the API, every user needs a set of `Access Key` and `Secret Key`. These can be managed from the option `API keys` on the dropdown menu, under the user's account.

You can watch step-by-step video guide below:

* **API Key Generation**

The generation of the API key can be achieved by clicking the `Generate new key` button.

.. note:: Make sure to copy the `Key secret` as it cannot be retrieved again.

* **API Key Revocation**

In case an API key gets lost or compromised, its revocation can be achieved  by the same menu.
