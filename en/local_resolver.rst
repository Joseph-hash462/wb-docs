Local DNS resolver
******************

Deploying the Whalebone solution deployed as a **local** resolver brings the advantage of visibility of local IP addresses that send the actual requests. If deploying locally is not a suitable option for you, 
check out the other deployment options `<https://docs.whalebone.io/en/adam-edited/deployment.html>`_
Whalebone resolver is based on the implementation of `Knot Resolver <https://www.knot-resolver.cz/>`_ developed in the CZ.NIC labs.
